            which show 500 species of lilacs in a floral masterpiece of the darkest purples 
            and purest whites, each May during the Annual Lilac Festival in Rochester's Highland Park.

            The Rochester Lilac Celebration, now in its 124th year, is the largest free festival 
            of its type. The Rochester Lilac Festival, which takes place every year in Highland Park, 
            draws almost half a million tourists from all over the world. 
            Every May, the festival kicks up on Mother's Day weekend. </p>
        
        <p>The Rochester Lilac Festival has plenty of live music 
            ranging from national touring performers to area players, in addition to the 
            flowers. There is also an award-winning Art in the Park art show, 
            as well as a Lilac 5K/10K, and a Special

        <p>The Rochester International Jazz Festival 
            has swiftly established itself as one of the country's most popular and well-respected 
            music events. Every summer, tourists from all over the United States and the world go to this city-wide music event.
            Over the course of the nine-day festival, over 1,500 musicians play in over 300 
            performances on both open-air stages and ticketed interior locations. The venues, 
            all within walking distance of one other in and around Rochester's east end cultural 
            area.</p>
        
        <p>The concerts showcase a diverse range of musical styles and a combination of local, 
            national, and international performers. Food, drinks, and other special events will 
            be available to visitors. Artists and guests are invited to the event at night.</p>

        <h1>Downloading and Installing Python</h1>
        <p>There are a few different ways to install Python on your Windows computer.  
            You can install it from Microsoft Store, from Python.org, or from a 
            Windows Subsystem for Linux.  Since you are here for learning Python or 
            brushing up on your knowledge of Python, we are going to just focus on 
            installing it from the Microsoft Store.</p>
        <p>The Microsoft Store package of Python is mostly intended for 
            students/beginners.  It is easier to install and setup than the other 
            two methods.  Once you become more experienced with Python and start 
            using it in a professional setting you will want to install it directly 
            from the Python website, but for now we will focus on installing the 
            version from the Microsoft Store.</p>

        <h1>Installing Python from the Microsoft Store</h1>
        <p>After completing the steps below, Python will be fully installed.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to Microsoft Store, the icon for it looks like this</li>
            <img src="../assets/images/microsoftIcon.png" alt="img1" title="img1">

            <li>Search “Python” in the search bar and click on the one that says, 
                “Python 3.10”, or any subsequent version.</li>
            <li>Once you have clicked on the latest version of Python click 
                “get” in the top right corner of your screen.</li>
            <li>Wait for the application to finish downloading, then when it’s 
                finished the “get” button should change to a button that says, 
                “install on my devices”.  Click that button and choose which devices 
                you wish to install Python onto.</li>
            <li>Finally, click “install now” and then “OK” to begin installation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Python OOP</h1>
        <p>
          Object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm in Python
          that employs objects and classes. It seeks to include real-world
          elements such as inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, and so on
          into programming. The primary idea behind OOPs is to tie the data and
          the functions that act on it as a single unit so that no other
          component of the code may access it.
          <br />

          <h4>Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)</h4>
          <ul class="no-bullets">

          <h4>Classes</h4>
          <p>
            A class is a collection of objects. A class holds the blueprints or
            prototypes from which the objects are built. It's a logical entity
            with some attributes and methods. <br /><br />
            To demonstrate the requirement for building a class, consider the
            following scenario: suppose you wanted to monitor the number of dogs
            with various properties such as breed and age. If you use a list,
            the first element may be the dog's breed, and the second element
            could be its age. Assume there are 100 distinct dogs; how would you
            know which one is meant to be which? What if you wanted to give
            these dogs other abilities? This lacks organization and it’s the
            exact need for classes.
          </p>

          <h4>Objects</h4>
          <p>
            The object is an entity with a specific state and behavior. It might
            be any real-world object, such as a mouse, keyboard, chair, table,
            pen, and so on. Objects include integers, strings, floating-point
            numbers, arrays, and dictionaries. An object is, more specifically,
            any single integer or string. The number 12 is an object, as is the
            text "Hello, world," and a list is an object that may house
            additional objects.
          </p>

          <h5>An object is made up of:</h5>

          <p>
            The attributes of an item indicate its state. It also reflects an
            object's properties.
            <br />
            Behavior is represented through an object's methods. It also
            represents an object's response to other objects.
            <br />
            Identity provides an object a unique name and allows one object to
            interact with other objects
          </p>
          <h5>
            To understand the state, behavior, and identity let us take the
            example of the class dog (explained above).
          </h5>
          <p>
            The identity can be considered as the name of the dog.
            <br />
            State or Attributes can be considered as the breed, age, or color of
            the dog.
            <br />
            The behavior can be considered as to whether the dog is eating or
            sleeping.

          <h4>Inheritance</h4>
          <p>
            Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the
            properties from another class. The class that derives properties is
            called the derived class or child class and the class from which the
            properties are being derived is called the base class or parent
            class. The benefits of inheritance are:
            <br />
            <br />
            1. It represents real-world relationships well.
            <br />
            2. It provides the reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the
            same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features
            to a class without modifying it.
            <br />
            3. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits
            from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would
            automatically inherit from class A.
          </p>
          <h5>Example: Inheritance in Python</h5>

          <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
          <p>
            Polymorphism simply refers to the existence of several forms.<br />
            For example, if we need to identify whether a specific species of
            bird can fly or not, we may accomplish it using polymorphism and a
            single function.

          <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
          <p>
            One of the core principles of object-oriented programming is
            encapsulation. It discusses the concept of data wrapping and the
            methods that interact with data as a single unit. This prevents data
            from being accidentally modified by restricting direct access to
            variables and methods. An object's variable can only be altered by
            an object's method to prevent unintentional changes. These variables
            are referred to as private variables.
